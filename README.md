## Naive Bayes Classifier

### Data Splitting:
- The dataset is split into training and test sets.

### Model Fitting:
- A Gaussian Naive Bayes model is fitted to the training data.

### Model Attributes:
- The trained model's unique classes, prior probabilities, mean, and variance of each feature for each class are obtained.

### Prediction:
- The model predicts probabilities and labels for the first five samples in the test set.

### Confusion Matrix:
- A confusion matrix is generated to compare predicted labels with actual labels.

### Probabilities Prediction (Extended):
- The model predicts probabilities for each class for the first five samples in the test set.
